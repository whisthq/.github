## Hi there üëã

Whist is building the world's first cloud-hybrid browser, a native browser with cloud tabs, designed to be crazy fast and light. 

We envision a world where your computer's battery lasts for days and your device never slows down or heats up, no matter how many heavy web applications or tabs you're running. To make this world a reality, we're building the world's first cloud-hybrid browser, a browser which integrates cloud tabs within a traditional browser framework. Cloud tabs are a new type of tabs which run in the cloud, with access to plenty of memory, a powerful graphics card and 2 Gbps Internet speed. On a cloud tab pages load instantly, heavy web applications (i.e. Figma/Bubble, Airtable/Notion, Google Sheets/Office, etc.) run blazingly fast, and your laptop never heats up or slow down. 

Use cloud tabs to speed up heavy web applications when you're in work mode, and use local tabs when you're on-the-go in a weak WiFi area or when browsing lightweight websites. Better yet, combine the two and make Whist the no-compromise browser, a browser that's exactly what you need it to be, designed to never get in your way so you can focus on what matters.
