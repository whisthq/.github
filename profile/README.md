## Hi there üëã

Whist is on a mission to build the world's fastest web browser.

We envision a world where your computer's battery lasts for days and your device never slows down, no matter how many browser tabs or web 
applications you're running. Today, we're building the world's fastest web browser that's streamed from a powerful datacenter to your computer.
This browser runs on plenty of RAM, a powerful graphics card and 1 Gbps Internet speed. Pages load instantly, heavy web applications (i.e.
Figma/Bubble, Airtable/Notion, Google Sheets/Office, etc.) run quickly, and your laptop doesn't heat up or slow down.

Sounds interesting? Check us out at https://whist.com.
