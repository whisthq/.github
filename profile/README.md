## Hi there üëã

Whist is building the Zero-Trust Browser for enterprises, a Chrome browser that enables secure remote work from any device.

With Whist you can fully isolate, control, and monitor how your employees access company resources on any device ‚Äî without the hassle of remote desktop. This makes Whist the ultimate secure browser to protect your data in the age of remote work while working with third-party partners, contractors, and remote employees on a constantly-shifting web of managed and unmanaged devices.
